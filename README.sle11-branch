The test cases and needles need to be up to date somehow and they change at
a very high pace.  So we pull in upstream via a separately cloned repo
(on the master branch) and just symlink to that, e.g. like this:

    git clone https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse opensuse-testcases

then just frequently 

    cd opensuse-testcases
    git pull

this looks hacky :)

consider submodules or special remotes with "subtree merges" as per
git submodules --help?
